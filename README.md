Compass HTML5 Starter
=========================

HTML5 Starter is a Compass extension based on [HTML5 Starter](https://github.com/rizkysyazuli/html5-starter), a fork of HTML5 Boilerplate by Paul Irish.
You can use it to kick-start a fully compliant HTML5 applications. Generating a set of starter files for your HTML5 projects with integrated Sass (Scss) templates.

Browse [html5boilerplate.com](http://html5boilerplate.com) for the full workup.


Installation
========================

    gem install html5-starter
    compass create my_project -r html5-boilerplate -u html5-boilerplate --javascripts-dir assets/js --css-dir assets/css --images-dir assets/img --sass-dir assets/css/src

The `--javascripts-dir`, `--css-dir`, `--images-dir` and `--sass-dir` flags are required to keep consistent with the original html5-starter project layout. If you omit them, be sure to edit your javascript and style tags accordingly in index.html.

Run `compass watch my_project` and the SCSS files will automatically get compiled to your Sass compilation directory whenever a change is made:

    assets/css/style.css
    assets/css/handheld.css

To see the complete list of files generated by this extension, see the [HTML5 Starter](https://github.com/rizkysyazuli/html5-starter) project repo.
